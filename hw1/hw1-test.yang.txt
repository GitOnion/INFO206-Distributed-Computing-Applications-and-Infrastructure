Test cases:

1. j
2. jY
3. jY23
4. jY23$
5. jy23$%
6. 1234
7. jordan
8. reng
9. supernov
10. zzzzzzzz
11. &amp
12. &amp;

Strategy:
 For the first part, I start with a combination of a single character, to see if the error message comes out as expected. Then I gradually add the missing element indicated in the message, one at a time.
 For the second part, I start with 1234, to make sure the iteration number comes out right. Then I test the best case: jordan, and then the second best: reng, and the third best: supernov, just to see the iteration numbers are right. Finally I test the edge cases: &amp and zzzzzzzz
